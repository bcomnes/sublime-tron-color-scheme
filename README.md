# sublime-tron-color-scheme

A standalone fork (and modification) of the Tron Legacy color scheme from [ColorSublime](http://colorsublime.com/?q=tron). Install the following package control package:

```
Tron Color Scheme
```

Then select the `Tron Legacy 4 (Dark)` color scheme from your preferences menu.

Supports all major syntaxes, Sublime Text 4 and is based on the new Marina syntax definition file (with some additional features.)
