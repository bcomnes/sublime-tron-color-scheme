# sublime-tron-color-scheme

A standalone fork of the Tron and Tron Legacy color schemes from [ColorSublime](http://colorsublime.com/?q=tron).

ColorSublime is fun to play around with, but I only want one package manager installed in my editor.  This gives you access to these themes without having to install ColorSublime.

Pairs nicely with the [spacegray](https://github.com/kkga/spacegray) UI theme and [Java​Script​Next - ES6 Syntax](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/JavaScriptNext%20-%20ES6%20Syntax) extended syntax highlighting.

Lacks good markdown or JSON support.
